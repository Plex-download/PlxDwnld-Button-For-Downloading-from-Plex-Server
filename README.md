# PlxDwnld-Button-For-Downloading-from-Plex-Server

A javascript bookmarklet that adds a Download Button to your Web Browser to Download Plex Movies and TV Shows at Full Original Quality from a Shared Server or Friends Server.
 
Step 1. As a pre-requisite, you need to either have Google Chrome or Firefox installed on your computer.  

Step 2. Open Chrome or Firefox and make sure your bookmark toolbar is visible. If its already visible then you can skip this step. If you are on a Windows computer hold down the “CTRL” key on your keyboard, then hold down “Shift” key, and while you continue holding down both of those buttons together just press the “B” key. You will see the bookmarks toolbar appear right underneath the address bar. CTRL + Shift + B
 
Step 3. Visit https://sharedriches.com/plex-scripts/piplongrun/

Step 4. Under “How to install”, drag the blue box up into the bookmark toolbar.

Step 5. Login to Plex website from the web browser(Chrome or Firefox).

Step 6: Find the Movie, TV Show Episode, or video you want to download and click on it to view the information about the movie or episode or video.

Step 7. Once you see information about the video such as in the images below, you are then ready to click on the Plex Download button that we added to the bookmark toolbar. (I have drawn a red box around what you should see on the pages. If you see that you are on the correct page.)

Movies Will Look like this:

The Movie or TV Show will begin to download. Then Go back and choose another Movie or TV Show to Download by simply click on the PlexDwnld button again.

If you are unable to get the Bookmark Toolbar to show up using the above method, try doing this. Click on the button with 3 horizontal bars/dots in the top right corner. After clicking this, the 4th or 5th option to choose will be “Bookmarks”. Select that. Then the third option down it will say “Show Bookmarks Bar/Toolbar”. Select that. If it instead says “Hide Bookmarks Toolbar” then that means your bookmarks toolbar is already visible and this step can be skipped.
